To Do (pick and choose!):

* Add a "Show Answer" button which shows the correct_answer
* Add a "Next Question" button which display the next question from data
* When you run out of question, refresh the quiz by calling getQuiz() again
* Add multiple choice answers for the user to see
* Allow the user to select an answer from a list of radio buttons (use JQuery for this, it will make finding which radio button is selected easier)
* Add a "Check answer" button which checks if the user has clicked the right radio button
* Style the whole thing nicely using CSS; pick a colour scheme and suitable font
* Show an error message if the response code on the JSON request is not 0
* Make sure the design is responsive: it looks good on big AND small screens, desktops AND mobile

ADVANCED

* Show 10 questions and calculate an overall score for all 10
* Add a "Choose category" dropdown which changes the OpenTDB.com query made appropriately
* Add a leaderboard which shows the highest scores
* Let user enter their name and be added to the leaderboard
* Make your quiz unique! Add extra game functions like "lifelines", "50/50", "phone a friend", a photograph of Jeremy Paxman, you name it!
